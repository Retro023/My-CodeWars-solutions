def greet(name):
    greeting = f"Hello, {name} how are you doing today?"
    return greeting

#we use a variable called greeting to store a formated string value that replaces the {name} with whatever the name is



####TASK#####
#Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; 
#your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".

#[Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]

def twice_as_old(dad_years_old, son_years_old):
    return  abs(son_years_old * 2 - dad_years_old)

#We use the method abs() to make sure its a  postive integer 
#we use a simple formula sons age x 2 - the dads age so for example,
#If the son is 10 and the dad is 40 we would do: t=∣10×2−40∣=∣20−40∣=20  (t = time),
#we then return it




###TASK####

#Your function takes two arguments:

#current father's age (years)
#current age of his son (years)
#Сalculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old). 
#The answer is always greater or equal to 0, no matter if it was in the past or it is in the future.
